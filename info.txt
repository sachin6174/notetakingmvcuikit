There are two storyboard files for different purposes:

  ðŸ“± Main.storyboard

  - Purpose: Contains the main app interface and user flows
  - Usage: Where you design your app's actual screens and navigation
  - Content: View controllers, segues, UI elements that users interact with
  - When shown: After the app launches and loads completely

  ðŸš€ LaunchScreen.storyboard

  - Purpose: Shows immediately when app starts (splash screen)
  - Usage: Displays while the app is loading in the background
  - Content: Simple, static elements (logo, loading indicator, app name)
  - When shown: The very first thing users see when tapping your app icon

  ðŸ”„ Why Two Separate Files?

  1. Performance: LaunchScreen loads instantly while Main.storyboard loads the full app
  2. Apple Requirement: iOS requires a launch screen for App Store submission
  3. User Experience: Provides immediate visual feedback while app initializes
  4. Different Constraints: Launch screens have specific Apple guidelines and limitations

  ðŸ“Š Typical Flow:

  User taps app icon â†’ LaunchScreen.storyboard (instant) â†’ App loads â†’ Main.storyboard (main UI)

  This is standard iOS architecture - every iOS app has both! The launch screen creates a seamless
  transition from icon tap to app ready.
